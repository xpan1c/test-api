# Technical Test: Node.js Backend Development

## Overview:
You are tasked with creating a simple backend service using Node.js that simulates a product inventory system for a small online store. This service should interact with a database or an in-memory data structure to manage product information. The service must expose an API that supports the following operations:

1. Search Products: Allow users to search for products by name. This should include basic filtering capabilities, such as by category or price range.
2. Read Product Details: Retrieve detailed information about a specific product by its ID.
3. Create/Update Product Information: Allow adding new products to the inventory and updating existing ones (e.g., price, stock quantity, description).
4. Delete Product: Remove products from the inventory.


### Technical Requirements:

- Use Node.js as the runtime environment.
- For data storage, use in memory db (object or array).
- Implement filtering capabilities in the search feature to demonstrate your understanding of query parameters and data manipulation.
- Ensure your code is well-organized, readable, and follows best practices for Node.js development.

### Optional Tasks:

- Unit/Integration Testing: Write tests for at least two of the API endpoints you create. This is to demonstrate your ability to write meaningful tests and ensure your application works as expected.
- Error handling.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality: The API should work as described, with all endpoints correctly implementing the required operations.
Code Quality: Your code should be clean, well-organized, and properly commented. It should follow best practices specific to Node.js and backend development.
- Error Handling: Properly handle and communicate errors, especially for edge cases (e.g., attempting to delete a product that doesn't exist).
- Testing (Optional): Well-written tests that cover key functionalities will be considered a plus.


### Submission Instructions:

- Complete your solution within 4 hours.
- Share your code before the deadline via GitHub private repository link. Send invite.

This test is designed to evaluate your technical skills in backend development using Node.js, your ability to interact with data storage systems, and your understanding of RESTful API principles. It also gives you the opportunity to showcase your problem-solving abilities, coding style, and attention to detail. Good luck!
